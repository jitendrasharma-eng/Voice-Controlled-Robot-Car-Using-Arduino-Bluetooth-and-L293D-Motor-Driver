# Voice-Controlled-Robot-Car-Using-Arduino-Bluetooth-and-L293D-Motor-Driver
This project demonstrates how to control a robot car using voice commands via Bluetooth. The system consists of an Arduino Uno, an HC-05 Bluetooth module, an L293D motor driver, and two DC motors. The user can send voice commands such as "forward", "backward", "left", "right", and "stop" to control the car.
